Links:
1) Links are files that reference other files. Used to avoid having duplicate files. Establish a pointer in one place to a destination in another
2) Two types of links: A hard link points to a specific data (by inode) on the disk, A soft link or symbolic link(symlink) points to another file



sed 
sed full form is stream editor. It's a powerful tool to edit text files from terminal.
1) If I want to replace hasrha with harsha in a file names.txt 
sed -i 's/hasrha/harsha/' names.txt
The -i flag stands for in-place editing. This command will directly modify the file names.txt by replacing the first occurrence of hasrha with harsha on each line. After running this, the file itself is updated—no output is printed to the terminal

sed 's/hasrha/harsha/' names.txt
This command does not modify the file. Instead, it reads names.txt, performs the substitution, and prints the result to standard output (your terminal). The original file remains unchanged unless you redirect the output to a new file, like: sed 's/hasrha/harsha/' names.txt > new_names.txt
